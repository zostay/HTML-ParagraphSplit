1.05 Sun Sep 30 19:31:00 2007
    - Bumped the version number to a one-point-ex level because it's complete.
    - Added a test for dependencies.
    - Added a test for POD Coverage.
    - Added two new sub-tests to reveal a bug in 0.04 in entity handling.
    - Fixed entity handling so that &lt; (et. al.) does not become < on output.
    - Removed a call to UNIVERSAL::isa() to a method call ->isa().
    - Added a preference for blessed() over ref(), in a couple places.

0.04 Sun Aug 26 21:45:00 2007
    - Fixed a minor documentation bug.
    - Switched to using Module::Install instead of Module::Build.

0.03 Sun Jul 30 16:52:00 2006
    - [rt.cpan.org #20759] FIXED: HTML::ParagraphSplit properly handles nested
      content that does not contain any breaks.

0.02 Sat Jul 22 21:43:00 2006
    - Fixed a bug that caused HTML::ParagraphSplit to fail in actual use even
      though all tests passed because the tests used HTML::TreeBuilder, but
      HTML::ParagraphSplit does not.
